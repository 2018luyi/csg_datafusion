    "# DICOMs reorganizer\n",
    "By Stephen Larroque @ Coma Science Group, GIGA Research, University of Liege\n",
    "Creation date: 2019-03-09\n",
    "License: MIT\n",
    "v1.2.7\n",
    "\n",
    "DESCRIPTION:\n",
    "Reorganize DICOM folders and zip files into neatly named DICOM folders. This also allows deduplication, since it's based on DICOM fields (it is suggested to use ids: study id, machine id, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative to this script, you can use dcm2niix renaming functionality, but it works only on DICOM folders (not zips). Example of commandline: `dcm2niix.exe -f %n_%t/%s_%p_%d_%z/%s_%n_%t_%p_%d_%z_%r.dcm -r y -d 9 -o output_dir input_dir`\n",
    "\n",
    "INSTALL NOTE:\n",
    "You need to pip install pandas before launching this script.\n",
    "Tested on Python 2.7.15\n",
    "\n",
    "USAGE:\n",
    "Input: a root folder containing your dicoms, it will be recursively processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO:\n",
    "* Zip each folder/subfolder when done? (at the end because duplicates might overwrite)\n",
    "* Check if file already exist before copying, if true make a list of conflicts so we know\n",
    "* copy/manage DICOMDIR files? https://www.medicalconnections.co.uk/kb/DICOMDIR/\n",
    "* add series number to be able to disambiguate multiple acquisitions of the same sequence (and also in what order, nice to guess if there was sedation)"
