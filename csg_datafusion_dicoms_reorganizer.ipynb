    "# Dicom reorganizer\n",
    "By Stephen Larroque @ Coma Science Group, GIGA Research, University of Liege\n",
    "Creation date: 2019-03-09\n",
    "License: MIT\n",
    "v1.2.3\n",
    "\n",
    "DESCRIPTION:\n",
    "Reorganize DICOM folders and zip files into neatly named DICOM folders (or DICOM zip files). This also allows deduplication, since it's based on DICOM fields (it is suggested to use ids: study id, machine id, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "INSTALL NOTE:\n",
    "You need to pip install pandas before launching this script.\n",
    "Tested on Python 2.7.15\n",
    "\n",
    "USAGE:\n",
    "Input: a root folder containing your dicoms, it will be recursively processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO:\n",
    "* Zip each folder/subfolder when done? (at the end because duplicates might overwrite)\n",
    "* Check if file already exist before copying, if true make a list of conflicts so we know\n",
    "* copy/manage DICOMDIR files? https://www.medicalconnections.co.uk/kb/DICOMDIR/"
